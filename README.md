# The Dunder Mifflin Pet Show


You're right on your way to help The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company with their brand new application. It is meant to 
showcase each of the employees' pets. Weâ€™ve started some of the work for you, and we need your help to get our site fully working! Here are the deliverables:

- Build out the associations for the models we've created. If you look into the `seeds.rb` file, you'll notice that we've put
in the desired models and expected associations to make our app work. **However**, you need to change the schema in order
for you to be able to run `rake db:seed`. Every employee can only be connected to a single dog, and a dog can have many owners.



BONUS: Make an option to sort the dogs on the index page by the number of employees that belong to them.
